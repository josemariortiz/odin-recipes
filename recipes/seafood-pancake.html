        Put the shrimp, clam, and squid into a bowl. Add green chili pepper,
        green onion, carrot, flour, potato starch, egg, water, fish sauce,
        kosher salt, black pepper, and toasted sesame oil. Mix it all together
        with a spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add about 2 to 3 tablespoons
        vegetable oil and swirl it around to coat evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take 1 or 2 spoonfuls of the mixture and place it on the skillet. Shape
        it to round, Â½ inch thick about 3 inch wide disks with the spoon. Make a
        few more disks until your skillet is comfortably full of them.
      </li>
      <li>
        About 2 minutes later, when the bottom of the pancakes turn a little
        crunchy, gently flip them over.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook another 2 minutes, and then flip them over again. Cook another 1 to
        2 minutes until both sides are light golden brown and crunchy.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate.</li>
      <li>
        Clean the skillet with paper towels, add 2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable
        oil and make pancakes with the rest of the batter mixture.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with rice, as a snack, or as a side dish for beer or soju.</li>
